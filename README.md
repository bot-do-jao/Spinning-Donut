# Spinning-Donut
Just myself going at the infamous donut.c file. Thought it would be fun to remember how C works, since I'll be using it again in just a few months

For real, I'll have to come back later to this project just so I can understand its math, the code alone is still kinda confusing, though understandable, since its structure is really simplified to a programmer's viewpoint. But code like this is like the reason why sotware engineers have to learn calculus and such.
